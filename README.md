# odin-recipes

I executed creating a github repo and cloned it.
Also created an index.html file, a recipes folder( containing two new html files - rice.html and spaghetti.html) and linked the pages to the index.html file.
Added and styled necessary images for more appealing visuals.
Further added headers, paragraphs, and lists to the two new pages (rice.html and spaghetti.html)
Staged all files and folders through 'git add'
Committed all staged files and folders through 'git commit'
Finally pushed to github with 'git push origin main'
