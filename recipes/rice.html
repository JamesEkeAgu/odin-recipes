    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      Let me introduce you to a delicious Persian rice dish made with golden
      potatoes and saffron
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>3 quarts water</li>
      <li>3 tablespoons Kosher salt</li>
      <li>2 cups basmati rice, rinsed</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
      <li>1 Russet potato, cut into 1/4-inch slices</li>
      <li>1 pinch ground cumin</li>
      <li>salt to taste</li>
      <li>3 tablespoons butter, cut into thin slices, or to taste</li>
      <li>1 pinch saffron threads</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons hot water</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon chopped parsley, or to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Place water and kosher salt in a pot; bring to a boil. Add rice; cook
        and stir for exactly 7 minutes. Drain.
      </li>
      <li>
        Heat olive oil in a pot over medium-high heat. Cover bottom of the pot
        with 1 layer of potato slices. Cook until potatoes are sizzling, 2 to 3
        minutes; top potatoes with rice to form an even layer. Reduce heat to
        low and place butter slices over rice.
      </li>
      <li>
        Top the pot with a clean layer of paper towels, then place the lid over
        the towels. Steam until rice is fluffy, about 45 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Grind saffron threads with a mortar and pestle. Mix crushed saffron with
        2 tablespoons hot water in a large bowl. Add a couple of spoonfuls of
        rice to saffron mixture and stir until rice is yellow.
      </li>
      <li>
        Spoon remaining rice into a serving bowl. Top with saffron rice and line
        the edges of the bowl with potatoes. Garnish with parsley.
      </li>
    </ol>
