    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      Spaghetti and meatballs is such a comfort food classic. The meatballs are
      made from ground beef and Italian sausage and served with a sauce made
      with mushrooms, onions, basil, and Parmesan.

    </ul>
    <h3>For the pasta</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        1 1/2 pounds dry 100% semolina spaghetti, thin spaghetti, or bucatini
      </li>
      <li>Salt, for the pasta water</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <p>
          Heat the olive oil in a 4 to 5-quart pot on medium-high heat. Add the
          onions and cook for 2 minutes. Add the garlic and cook for 30 seconds
          longer or until fragrant.
        </p>
        <p>
          Add the carrots and mushrooms, and cook for 2 minutes. Add the tomato
          paste, stir to blend, and cook for a minute longer.
        </p>
        <p>
          Add the canned tomatoes, parsley, and basil. Mash and stir the
          tomatoes with a potato masher until the sauce starts to thicken, about
          5 minutes over medium-high heat.
        </p>
        <p>
          Reduce the heat to low and simmer gently while preparing meatballs,
          stirring occasionally.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          In a large bowl, use your hands to mix the beef, Italian sausage,
          basil, parsley, mushrooms, eggs, breadcrumbs, cheese, salt, and
          pepper. Do not over-mix or the meatballs will be tough.
        </p>

        <p>
          Use a small melon baller, cookie scoop, or heaping teaspoon to form
          1-inch round meatballs. Roll and compress into tight balls, but don't
          overwork the mixture.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          In a separate wide, shallow pan, heat the olive oil on medium-high
          heat. Brown the meatballs on all sides, about 2 to 3 minutes.
        </p>
        <p>
          Depending on pan size you may need to brown 2 batches of the
          meatballs. Cook them in a single layer; do not crowd the pan by
          stacking them.
        </p>
        <p>
          Do not overcook the meatballs; they will continue to cook in the
          sauce. You just want to brown them on all sides. Towards the end of
          browning the meatballs, add a little bit of red wine to deglaze the
          pan.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        Add the red wine to the sauce and stir in the cheese. Add salt to taste.
        Add the browned meatballs and gently stir. Simmer the sauce and
        meatballs for 30 to 45 minutes, stirring occasionally.
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          While the sauce is simmering, bring a large pot with 4 quarts of
          salted water to a boil (1 tablespoon of salt for every 2 quarts of
          water). When the water returns to a boil add the pasta to the pot.
        </p>
        <p>
          Leave the pot uncovered while you cook the pasta on high heat with a
          vigorous boil. Put a timer on for 8 to 10 minutes, or according to
          package directions for al dente pasta (cooked but still a little
          firm). Drain.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        To serve, place a thin layer of sauce on each plate, add the pasta, add
        sauce and meatballs, and then sprinkle with grated Parmesan-Romano
        cheese.
      </li>
    </ol>
